# The "Hello World" of Deep Learning : training a deep learning model to correctly classify hand-written digits
Libraries: Keras + TensorFlow

Steps: 
1. Loading the Data Into Memory (with Keras)
2. Splitting it into training and validation data and thus labeling it accordingly
3. Preparing the data. (Data Pre-Processing) 
    - Flatten- Convert 2d array to 1d
    - Normalize- The data is in the range of 0 to 255, Converting it into a range varying from 0 to 1
    - Categorize- makes data more understandable for the machine
4. Creating the model
    - Instantiating the model
    - Creating the input layer
    - Creating the hidden layer
    - Creating the output layer
    - Summarizing the model
    - Compiling the model
5. Training the model
6. Observing Accuracy
